              <h1>How to choose the best type of tea in Sri Lanka?</h1>
              <p>A lot of it comes down to your personal preferences for flavor.<br>
                Green, black, oolong and white tea each have distinct flavors, some of which you may like more than others. <br>
                White tea tends to have the lightest flavor with a refreshing quality. <br>
                On the other end of the scale, black tea tends to serve up a strong flavor.<br>
                Many tea varieties also have other flavoring in them, such as mint, fruit or herbs.</p>

              <h2>Here are some tips in choosing the right tea</h2>
              <p> <b>Choose loose leaf:</b>Loose leaf tea is often fresher than tea that comes in bags, which likely sits on the shelves for months. Loose leaf tea also tends to incorporate better parts of the tea leaves instead of the stems and seeds that normally end up in bagged teas.<br><br>
                <b> Boost energy with black tea:</b> If you’re looking for an alternative to coffee, black tea may be the solution. It has a more intense flavor and has the highest caffeine content to get you going.<br><br>
                <b>Experiment:</b>  It may take some experimentation to find the perfect tea for your tastes. The way tea is processed affects the flavor, so explore not only different varieties, but also different brands. If you don’t like green tea from one company, try a green tea from a different brand.<br><br>
                 While no benefits are guaranteed and studies sometimes produce mixed results, tea is a safe beverage that could give you some big health benefits. Grab your favorite tea cup and brew up your favorite tea blend.</p>
