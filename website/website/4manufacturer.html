            <h2>SRI LANKAN TEA MANUFACTURERS</h2>
            <p class="a">Celebrated to be the finest in the world, the unique flavour, fragrance and freshness of Ceylon Tea set it apart from the rest.
                 Represented by the Lion logo and the ‘Ceylon Tea’ trademarks assuring that it’s a quality product of Sri Lanka, Ceylon Tea is exclusively handpicked by expert tea pluckers and is mostly produced through orthodox and artisanal methods. 
                 It is also the freshest tea available in the global market, expertly packed within 3 weeks of harvesting, to preserve freshness, flavour, and aroma. 
                 Ceylon Tea is the first Ozone Friendly Tea in the world and does not use Methyl-Bromide during packaging and shipping.</p>
