If using store-bought tea bags, simply add a tea bag to a mug and fill it with the hot water. If using loose leaf tea, use 2–3 grams of tea leaves for every six ounces(3-4 cups) of water in a strainer. Let the tea steep in the water for 3–5 minutes, depending on your taste preference. For a stronger tea, use more tea leaves and steep for a longer period. After steeping, remove the tea leaves or tea bag from the water and enjoy it.</td>

Further, we use DUST tea grade to make very strong black tea blending with similar tea grades. For example, this tea grade is perfect for milk tea blends such as Hongkong Milk tea. In Sri Lanka, all our tea factories produce DUST tea grades in all regions. However, low grown dust tea makes a strong, robust, and bitter taste for your cup.</td>

Personal tastes, vary, of course — you’ll want to adjust the measurements and brewing times according to your own preferences. Add sweetener/milk according to your own preferences.  </td>
